# HTML-CSS-Git-Challenge
## First Challenge of the Coding Boot Camp!
**Refactor code for a "marketing firm" to add greater accessibility their page**

[Here is the link to the deployed page!](https://eclevela-1234.github.io/HTML-CSS-Git-Challenge/)

## Purpose of Webpage
- Informative landing page
- What they do -> Benefits you!

## Starter Code Notes
- Nav shortcuts in header (one is broken)
- Website title is not descriptive
- Images load brutally slow and lack alt descriptions
- Lots of duplication in the CSS

## Improvements Made
- Added title to webpage
- Resized images to 4MP for quicker loading
- Refactored css to remove duplication
- Ordered css with global styling first
- Rearanged code to match flow of HTML
- Added comments to CSS/HTML 

## Final Thoughts
While the website is very simple, this was a great opportunity to gain real experience refactoring code. Coding is iterative and most developers will have to work with someone else's code regularly. This type of foundational assignment was invaluable.

We were told to follow the scout rule and leave the code cleaner than I found it. I certainly hope this has been accomplished and look forward to more challenges!
